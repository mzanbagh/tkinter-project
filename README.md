# TKinter-project

<p> Tkinter is a Python binding to the TK GUI toolkit. It is the standard Python interface to the TK GUI toolkit. Tkinter is included with standard Linux, Microsoft Windows, and macOS installs of Python.
<p> The TKinter package is a thin object-oriented layer on top of tCl/Tk. In TKinter to perform an action on a widget use the widget name as a command and follow it with an action name, possibly with arguments.

+ Entry
+ Frame
+ Label

control vehicle registration using the TKinter package with Python along with a simple text file acting as the Database.
